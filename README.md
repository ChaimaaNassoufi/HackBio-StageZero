# HackBio Stage One: Single-Cell Analysis

This repository contains my Stage Zero HackBio project on **single-cell transcriptomics**. The goal was to interpret cell types and understand biological context in a dataset.

##  Project Highlights

- **UMAP visualization** of single-cell clusters
- Annotated **cell types** with biological roles
- Tissue source analysis and patient health interpretation
- Evidence-driven insights into immune cell landscapes

##  Key Findings

- **Cell types identified**: Neutrophils, Monocytes, B cells, T cells, NK cells, Platelets, Plasma cells
- **Tissue source**: Bone marrow (based on progenitor presence and expected lineage distributions)
- **Patient status**: Healthy (based on cell type proportions)

##  Example Insight

- Observed expanded **NK cell activation**, suggesting immune readiness rather than infection.
- Platelet proportion aligns with normal hematopoiesis.
